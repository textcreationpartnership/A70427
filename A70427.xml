            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOme Readers may imagine that it is no hard matter to deſcribe a Country ſo near, ſo full of Learned men and ſo ſtor'd with excellent Books as <hi>France</hi> is, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for a Native of it, becauſe of the many helps an Author may meet with. I have made uſe of all thoſe I could come at, Books, Maps, Memoirs, Inquiries of living perſons, beſides what I knew of my own. But I was ſoon aware, that the Deſcription of thoſe who have Written before me, even in the middle of that Kingdom, are very imperfect. All the Journeys into <hi>France</hi> I have read, as <hi>du Verdier, Sinceri Accii Itinerarium Galliae, Le Grand Tour de France, les Delices de la France,</hi> and the late <hi>Voyages Hiſtoriques de l'Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> obſerve neither order nor method, confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only the ſeveral Counties into which each great Government is ſubdivided, but even the great Governments themſelves. As to Geographers <hi>Comminges</hi> and <hi>Darity</hi> are too old and confus'd. The Maps of <hi>Sanſon</hi> the Father and the Son, are excellent, thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:38412:5"/> of <hi>Du Val</hi> next to them, and by compar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng them together, as I have done, one may be pretty ſure of the Longitude and Latitude, ſituation and diſtance of places. But neither of the <hi>Sanſons</hi> has made a modern and particular Deſcription of <hi>France,</hi> and that of <hi>Du Val</hi> is too ſhort and not methodical enough. As to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. <hi>Andre du Cheſne</hi> in his curious Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries concerning the Towns of <hi>France</hi> is full of Fables, and ought not to be follow'd but very cautiouſly, tho he is a Man of a vaſt reading and much to be commended for having pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſeveral Hiſtorians of the middle Age that have Written of the <hi>French</hi> affairs, and made uſe of them in his Antiquities of that Country and Monarchy. <hi>Joſeph Scaliger,</hi> how Learned ſoever he may be in other things, does not come near <hi>Du Cheſne</hi> in this, and propoſes many bold conjectures, concerning the ancient names of the <hi>French</hi> Cities and Countries, for which he often gives no other authority but his bare ſaying. <hi>Baudrand</hi> is but a pitiful compiler of modern Books, who never look'd into ancient Authors. <hi>Sanſon</hi> in his <hi>Pharus Galliae Antiquae</hi> is more accurate than the fore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Writers, and has made many curious and uſeful diſcoveries. But the moſt exact of all in my Judgment is <hi>Adrian de Valois</hi> in his <hi>Notitia Galliarum,</hi> as to the <hi>Latin</hi> names of Places, for there is hardly any thing elſe in that huge <hi>Folio,</hi> beſides ſome few hints of Hiſtory to be g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther'd here and there with great trouble.</p>
            <p>I have perus'd three other modern Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers which I muſt not forget, <hi>viz. Robbe</hi>'s <hi>Memoires Geographiques, Morery</hi>'s <hi>Grand Diction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naire
<pb facs="tcp:38412:5"/> Hiſtorique and Geographique,</hi> with the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of <hi>Perayre,</hi> and <hi>De la Croix</hi>'s <hi>Geographie <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſelle.</hi> As to the firſt, he cannot commit many faults, for he has almoſt nothing beſides <hi>French</hi> names; but as ſoon as he preſumes to ſay ſomething more, for inſtance to determine the extent of a Government or its Latitude and Longitude, one may very near be ſure to find him in an error.

               <p>
                  <hi>FRANCE</hi> has not changed her ancient Limits to the South, Weſt and North; ſeeing, as <hi>Gallia</hi> of old, it has to the Weſt, the Ocean of <hi>Aquitain;</hi> to the North, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ocean as far as <hi>Calis,</hi> by which Sea it is divided from <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea on the South, which is alſo called the <hi>French</hi> Sea, with the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountains that part her from <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to her Limits on the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>North-East,</hi> they are very uncertain, eſpecially in this time of War: Before the late Conqueſts, it was bounded by the County of <hi>Burgundy Elzas,</hi> the Dukedom of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Barrois,</hi> and part of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands; viz.</hi> the Province of <hi>Luxembourg, Hainault, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> But at preſent the <hi>French</hi> King is Maſter of all thoſe Countries, except of a little part: So that his Kingdom has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt recover'd its ancient Limits on that ſide <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the Mouth of the <hi>Meuſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her Form is almoſt round, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner oval, ſo that ſhe is as broad as long, and may be of 25 days Journey in length, from <hi>Breſt</hi> to <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and of as many in breadth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38412:8"/> from <hi>Dunkerque</hi> to <hi>Perpignan,</hi> that is 250 Leagues, which make about 1000 Leagues in circuit.</p>
               <p>The ancient <hi>Galli,</hi> called <hi>Celtae,</hi> tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves into <hi>Aſia,</hi> where they gave their Name to a whole Country, called <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, Gallo-Graecia,</hi> or <hi>Gallia Minor,</hi> and now <hi>Chiangare,</hi> being part of <hi>Natoly,</hi> or <hi>Leſs Aſia.</hi> Another Colony of the <hi>Gallick Nation</hi> having paſſed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> conquered a good part of <hi>Italy,</hi> which made the <hi>Romans</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them into <hi>Ciſalpins</hi> and <hi>Tranſalpins.</hi> However, the Country on this ſide the <hi>Alpes</hi> retained the ancient Name of <hi>Gallia;</hi> and falling afterwards under the Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was divided by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> into four Parts, <hi>viz. Gallia Narbonenſis,</hi> called alſo <hi>Gallia Braccata,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Braccae,</hi> a kind of broad long Coats the Inhabitants wore. The other Parts were, the <hi>Celtick Gallia,</hi> or that of <hi>Lyons;</hi> the <hi>Belgick,</hi> and the <hi>Aquitanick,</hi> which had all three the common Surname of <hi>Gallia Comata,</hi> becauſe the People of thoſe Provinces ſuffered their hair to grow long.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aquitain</hi> at <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s time was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended between the River <hi>Garumn,</hi> the Sea, and the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountains; but was afterwards extended by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> as far as the River <hi>Loire</hi> on the North, and the Mountains of the <hi>Cevennes</hi> on the Eaſt, and ſubdivided into firſt, ſecond and third <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> Its ancient Inhabitants had ſeveral
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38412:9"/> different Names, which we ſhall mention in the particular Deſcription of that part of <hi>France.</hi> It ſuffices at preſent to obſerve, that it is now wholly in the <hi>French</hi> King's hands, but heretofore belong'd for the moſt part to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Celtick Gallia,</hi> or that of <hi>Lyons,</hi> was included between the Ocean on the Weſt and North-Weſt, the <hi>Belgick</hi> on the North-Eaſt and Eaſt, <hi>Aquitain</hi> and the Province of <hi>Narbonne</hi> on the South. It was divided into firſt, ſecond, third, fourth and fifth; in which Diviſion, 'tis worthy our Notice, that a good part of the 2d and 3d was either the ancient Patrimony of our Engliſh Kings, as <hi>Normandy;</hi> or fell to them by Marriage and Inheritance, as <hi>Le Maine, Anjou,</hi> and <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine.</hi> As to the fifth <hi>Lugdunenſis,</hi> call'd alſo <hi>Provincia Sequanorum,</hi> before the laſt Peace of <hi>Nimeguen</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King poſſeſſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it: but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having yielded him the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and he being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Savoy, Newchaſtel, Elzas</hi> and <hi>Sungow,</hi> the Republick of the <hi>Suitzers,</hi> which lays in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in his Dominions, muſt neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Narbonenſis</hi> had <hi>Aquitain</hi> on the Weſt, the <hi>Celtick</hi> on the North, the <hi>Alpes</hi> on the Eaſt, the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea and the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naean</hi> Mountains on the South. It was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into firſt, ſecond and third; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards extended farther on the Eaſt, beyond
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38412:9"/> the <hi>Alpes</hi> &amp; to the <hi>Appennin</hi> Mountains: then it was called <hi>Viennenſis,</hi> and ſubdivided into firſt, ſecond, third, fourth and fifth. The <hi>French</hi> having conquered during this preſent War the Dukedom of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the County of <hi>Nice,</hi> are now Maſters of all that large Country; except the County <hi>Venaiſin,</hi> which they have reſtored to the Pope, the Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Valais,</hi> called by the Ancients <hi>Gallia Subalpina,</hi> poſſeſſed by the Warlike Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Belgick,</hi> divided into firſt and ſecond, was of a vaſt extent, comprehending not only the Seventeen Provinces of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> except <hi>Frieſe, Groeningen</hi> and <hi>Overyſſel,</hi> but alſo <hi>Picardy, Champaign,</hi> part of the <hi>Iſle of France, Lorrain, Elzas,</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Liege,</hi> the four Electorates along the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the Dukedoms of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Juliers.</hi> The <hi>French,</hi> who in the former Reigns poſſeſſed but a ſmall part of the <hi>Belgick,</hi> have almoſt ſwallow'd up all that Country, there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing entire, but the Dukedoms of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Juliers,</hi> and the Dominions of the States-General; for the Biſhoprick of <hi>Liege</hi> and the four Electotates are either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, or lie open before them.</p>
               <p>The Diviſion of <hi>France,</hi> as to the Civil Government, may be made into certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces: The twelve Ancient, whoſe Deputies had their Seat in the general Aſſemblies of the Kingdom, are, 1. <hi>Picardy.</hi> 2. <hi>Normandy.</hi>

               <p>In reference to the Courts of Juſtice, <hi>France</hi> is divided into ten Parliaments, to which the Seneſchalſhips or Bailywicks do anſwer.</p>
               <p>The Names of thoſe ten Parliaments are, <hi>Paris; Toulouſe,</hi> for <hi>Languedock</hi> and part of <hi>Guienne; Dijon,</hi> for the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Breſſe; Roan,</hi> for <hi>Normandy; Bourdeaux,</hi> for <hi>Guyenne; Rennes,</hi> and lately <hi>Vannes,</hi> for <hi>Britanny; Grenoble,</hi> for <hi>Dauphiné; Aix,</hi> for <hi>Provence; Pau,</hi> for <hi>Bearn</hi> and <hi>Navar; Mets,</hi> for the Country of <hi>Meſſin</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> which extends its Juriſdiction over all the conquer'd <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Sovereign Courts of Juſtice at <hi>Briſach, Arras, Tournny, Perpignan</hi> and <hi>Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol;</hi> they depend, for the moſt Part, on the Government of <hi>Picardy;</hi> but the Dutchy of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> is annexed to that of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> however, bares not the Title

               <p>There are ſixteen Archbiſhopricks in <hi>France,</hi> nine of which pretend to the Right of Primacy; the ſeven others are, <hi>Paris, Tours, Auch, Alby, Tolouze, Ambrun,</hi> and <hi>Aix;</hi> the Primates are, <hi>Sens, Lyons, Bourges, Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne, Roan, Bourdeaux, Vienne, Arles,</hi> and <hi>Rheims.</hi> The New Conqueſts have ſince added two Archbiſhopricks, <hi>viz.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountains do not ſo much belong to <hi>France,</hi> which they do part from <hi>Spain,</hi> as the <hi>Cevennes,</hi> which are in the heart of the Country, and have been known to the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> under the Name of <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> has alſo her Promontories upon the Coaſt of her Seas, as well Ocean as Mediterranean. On the Weſt-ſide looking towards <hi>Britanny,</hi> and the North over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt <hi>Kent,</hi> are thoſe of the Ocean Sea; That of <hi>Talmond,</hi> or <hi>Talon du monde,</hi> is toward the South in the ſame Sea, with that of <hi>Buts,</hi> which has divers Names, and ſome others.

               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> wants no good Ports, whether in the Ocean or Mediterranean Sea. In the Ocean, on the Coaſt of <hi>Britanny,</hi> are, <hi>Brest, Conquest, Blavet;</hi> and <hi>Rochell</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Poictou.</hi> In the Mediterranean <hi>Marſeille</hi> and <hi>Toulon,</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Provence,</hi> good and renowned Havens, by the Galleys which the French King keeps there. That on the Coaſt of <hi>Agde</hi> is alſo conſiderable.</p>
               <p>The Rivers of <hi>France</hi> are many, very beautiful, and of long Courſe. The Chiefeſt are, the <hi>Seine,</hi> the <hi>Loire,</hi> the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and the <hi>Rhoſne.</hi> The <hi>Garonne</hi> ſprings from the <hi>Pyrenaeans,</hi> and has always been the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Aquitains</hi> from the <hi>Celtae,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the <hi>Dourdogne,</hi> the <hi>Tart</hi> and <hi>Loth,</hi> and is loſt in the Ocean.

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Inhabitants of <hi>France,</hi> and of their Language.</head>
               <p>THE French are Endowed with more Virtuos than Vices, by the Confeſſion even of Strangers, who praiſe them for their Charity, hoſpitality, Courteſie, Valour, and Bravery; and for their being fit, and as 'twere, born to all that they are minded to Undertake in Learning, War, or Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks; wherein they very Expeditiouſly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate whatever they ſee perform'd by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. They are very cleanly in their Diet and Apparel, and very apt in the one or the other to go beyond their Means, Quality, and Birth; which, by comparing them to Spaniards, Italians, and other Nations, has been taken notice of. Their Cloathing, as to the Making, is never certain, no more as to the Mode then as to the Stuff, wherein continually they change, at leaſt from year to year.</p>
               <p>The Men here are Comelier and Stronger, and of a finer ſize than Spaniards and Italians, but not then the Germans, Dutch, or Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. As to the Women, they are Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer In ſome Provinces than others; For in <hi>Normandy, Picardy,</hi> and on this ſide the <hi>Loire,</hi> they are commonly more agreeable
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38412:15"/> than in the ancient <hi>Aquitain;</hi> that is, in <hi>Auvergne, Perigord,</hi> the Country of <hi>Limoges, Gaſcony,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Languedoc.</hi> The other part of <hi>Guienne,</hi> eſpecially at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> part of <hi>Dauphiné, Lower Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> ſhew more pleaſing Faces, and even exquiſite Beauties: As we have ſaid that the French Man renders himſelf fit for every Thing, he is chiefly ſo in Arms and War-fare: He likewiſe gives himſelf over to Study, Eloquence, to all Arts, and to Merchandize: He carries freely his Trade to Foreign Nations, and there Manures the Land, and knows not to be Lazy: He is very Induſtrious, and Works merrily, though he is found fault with for not being Patient and willing to endure in War. The French Nobility are above all moſt rare Horſemen, and have a particular Care of their Honour, even to exceſs: witneſs, the damnable cuſtom of Duels, which the Edicts of the preſent Prince have not yet been able totally to ſuppreſs. The People of <hi>France</hi> are generally Meek and Good every where, except in ſome few places, where they are a little too Blunt and Ruſtick. The Vulgar bears an extream Reſpect to great Perſons, whether they be of the Nobility, Officers of Juſtice, or of the Revenues. Eccleſiaſticks, and other Men of Long Gown, are eſpecially Honoured; And there is hardly any Nation in the World that has ſo many Officers of all ſorts
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38412:15"/> as the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> The Merchant, nay, and the very Tradeſman, if at any time he becomes Wealthy, puſhes his Children to it: And into ſeveral Parliaments of <hi>France,</hi> and other Courts of Juſtice, the Nobility Sues for Offices too; whence comes that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of literate Men, though their Reward be but ſmall, and that all Offices be Sold; which is not uſual in other States of <hi>Europe.</hi> Thence alſo proceeds a ſwarm of Advocates, Sollicitors, Regiſters, Notaries, and other Men of Buſineſs, whoſe number has been extraordinarily increas'd by the late Edicts of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, and his Creation for Money of an incredible number of new Officers, which muſt needs impoveriſh the Kingdom, and bring it at laſt to an utter Ruin. For either theſe new Offices will be ſuppreſs'd in time of Peace, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great many Families will be Ruin'd that have beſtow'd their ready Money, and ſome their Eſtates upon theſe Employments: Or, if they be continued, the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will be oppreſs'd by the multitude of Officers, and the number of Merchants, Trades and Husbandmen mightily dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.</p>
               <p>Another great Abuſe that may prove at laſt the Ruin of <hi>France,</hi> is the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary increaſe of the Gentry; For whereas in <hi>England,</hi> younger Brothers even of the greateſt Noblemen make no difficulty of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38412:16"/> becoming Merchants, nay and Tradeſmen too, if they have no inclination to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The youngeſt Son of a ſimple Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in <hi>France</hi> would account it a great Diſhonour to his Birth to do any thing but to wear a Gown, or a Sword; which makes that the French Gentry, who is almoſt as numerous as the other Inhabitants, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſiſt in time of Peace.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Faults which the French have common, with other Nations, as to be too much given to Play, to Women, Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, Blaſphemies, and Curſings, it cannot be deny'd but that they are Haſty and Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick; However you will find amongſt 'em very few inſtances of thoſe ſecret and awful Revenges that are ſo often practis'd by ſome of their Neighbours. As to their Levity, we may in their behalf make uſe of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's ſaying, <hi>That they are Wiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any ſhew of it:</hi> For though they are not ſo Crafty as the Italians, nor ſo Vain and Proud as the Spaniards, yet do they not want Policy and Cunning. Finally the French are very Religious, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways feared their Gods; and whatever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they Embraced, they firmly ſtick'd to it. The frequent Wars which they have Undertaken or Suffered upon this account, ſhew the Truth of this Aſſertion. They are very Reſpectful to Ladies, and give them large Liberty; neither do they ſhut them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38412:16"/> up as the Italians and Spaniards do; whence it comes that they are cordially Beloved and ſerved by their Wives; and that the Viſits and Practiſes of young Women end generally in a happy Wedlock.</p>
               <p>The French Tongue for the moſt part is a Branch of the Latin: The Romans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Maſters of the Country, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing their Laws in it, changed the Speech of the Natural Inhabitants, or by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle made them looſe it. If the German Tongue had been there ſpoken before, or the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, they were at laſt totally routed, and a kind of corrupted Latin took their place. Now a days each Province has its peculiar manner of Speaking and Dialect; However there is ſtill a difference of Speech betwixt the Provinces on this ſide the <hi>Loire,</hi> and thoſe beyond it: The firſt Speak French, and the laſt Gaſcon, taking this Word as uſually taken at <hi>Paris;</hi> for thoſe of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Dauphiné, Provence,</hi> and <hi>Guyenne,</hi> the Latin Tongue having left deeper Footſteps of its Reſidence in thoſe four Provinces than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the other French, whoſe Language is purer, eſpecially about <hi>Blois, Orleance,</hi> and <hi>Paris.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Riches, Strength, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>France.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> is Rich and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by its Situation, by the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of its Cities and Inhabitants, and by its Wares of all Sorts, of which there is a great Trade. As to the Riches, the King takes what he pleaſes in his Taxes, Exciſe upon Salt, Impoſitions upon Merchandiſes that go out and are brought into <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Patrimony, whereupon the Kings have lived during a long time. The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Kingdom before the Dutch War of 1672, were deem'd to amount to 170000000 Livres, that is, about 15000000 Sterling, but have ever ſince ſtill diminiſh'd, partly by the continual Taxes that impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the People, and partly by the ſtop which the Wars have put to Trade; but much more by the Perſecution of the Proteſtants, which has made the price of the Lands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably fall, diſturb'd the Traffick of the Realm, and depriv'd it of great Sums of ready Money, which the French Refugees have brought over with 'em into Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>The French Monarchy ſtrove many Ages before it came to that high Point of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur to which it has attained of late. The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38412:17"/> Weakneſs of <hi>Charlemaign</hi>'s Succeſſors, and the Incurſions of the <hi>Normans,</hi> had reduced it to ſo narrow Limits, that the French King was hardly Sovereign in <hi>Paris.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the ſeveral Counties and Provinces taking hold of the occaſion, made their Charges Hereditary; and ſoon after ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd themſelves Lords of the Countries they Govern'd: So that <hi>France</hi> at that time was rather an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> or a Confederacy of ſeveral Petty-Princes under the French King their Head, as <hi>Germany</hi> now is under the Emperor, then a Monarchy properly ſo call'd. But the Victories which <hi>Charles</hi> VII got over the Engliſh in the Fifteenth Age, during the Wars of the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> gave him means to Unite to his Crown the large Provinces of <hi>Guyenne</hi> and <hi>Normandy;</hi> together with <hi>Poictou, le Maine,</hi> and <hi>Tourain.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38412:18"/> 
                  <hi>Spain, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and Lord of all the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the French Kings Juriſdiction was yet increas'd by the Acceſſion of <hi>Bearn</hi> or <hi>Lower Navarre,</hi> of which <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was in Poſſeſſion when he came to that Crown; And by his Acquiſition of the Province of <hi>Breſſe,</hi> with the Lands of <hi>Bugey, Valromey,</hi> and the Bailwick of <hi>Gex,</hi> which he Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed with <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> for ſome Pretenſions on the Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate of <hi>Saluſſes</hi> in 1601. <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. his Son Diveſted the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> of his Dutchy; the Emperor and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> of a good part of <hi>Elzas</hi> and the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands;</hi> and this preſent King has not only Conquer'd the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Elzas,</hi> but puſh'd ſo far his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> that what now remains in the Hands of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is not able to withſtand him any long time.</p>
               <p>The Authority of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchs grew ſtronger and more abſolute within their Kingdom, as the Bounds of it were extended without; at leaſt in this latter Age. For in former times, even that mighty Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Charlemaign</hi> would do nothing without the Advice of his Barons; no, not ſo much as eſtabliſh and endow a Biſhoprick: and by their means it was, that his Son, <hi>Lewis the Pious,</hi> was re-inthron'd. The Power of the <hi>French</hi> Lords laſted not only under the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38412:18"/> Race, but three or four Ages too under the Third. And as theſe petty Princes were extinguiſhed, their Authority was transferr'd to the States of the ſeveral Provinces, under whoſe hands it remained, till the Civil Wars, under the pretence of Religion, gave a mighty check to it; and the ſhrewd Policy of the Cardinals <hi>Richelieu</hi> and <hi>Mazarine</hi> made it altogether arbitrary.</p>
               <p>Now the French Kings pretend that they are Emperors in <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Bodin</hi> and <hi>du Tillet</hi> have endeavoured to prove; That their Authority is Abſolute and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and that as to the Temporal they have no other Superior than God alone, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom their Crown immediately depends, it not being in the Power of the Prelates of their Kingdom either to excommunicate them, or to publiſh them to be ſuch. By reaſon of their Conſecration, they are look'd upon to be of the Body of ſeveral Cathedral Churches in <hi>France,</hi> where they hold the Prebends. The nominating to Biſhopricks, Abbeys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> belongs to them, even by the Pope's Conſent, and the <hi>Concordat</hi> made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Francis</hi> I. and <hi>Leo</hi> X. They alone can make Laws in their Kingdom, grant Favors and Pardons, naturalize Strangers, and legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Baſtards. They build Colleges, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, Courts and Companies of Juſtice, create Offices, and provide for the ſame.</p>

               <p>The Males only, by Salique Law, which the French call the Fundamental of the State, have Right to Succeſſion, and the Crown always is devolved to the next Heir, that is, to the eldeſt Son of the King, and to the Iſſues of the eldeſt Infinitely.

               </p>
               <p>The three <hi>French</hi> Companies have been inſtituted by three ſeveral Kings, and wear upon their Arms and Caſſocks the Livery, Colours and Devices of the Reigning Kings. Thoſe that are called <hi>Exempts of the Guards,</hi> precede the other Archers; they wear nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hoquetons</hi> nor Caſſocks, and command the Guards in the abſence of their Officers: They carry a Stick, as a Mark of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Employment.</p>
               <p>The hundred <hi>Switzers</hi> wear the King's Livery, with a Halbert, and are cloathed after their own Country faſhion. Theſe four Companies have their Captains, who are all qualified Lords.

               <p>There is no ſharing in the Royal Houſe and Succeſſion, ſince the Third Stock of the Kings of <hi>France;</hi> ſo that ſecond Brothers

               <p>The Daughters of the French Kings have not any other Portions than Sums of Money, inſtead of Lands, which they have had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Chief Officers of the Crown and Kingdom.</head>
               <p>THE greateſt Office of the King's Houſe, is that of Grand Maſter of his Houſe, before whom, all the Officers that ſerve therein take the Oaths, and whom they are to obey. There is a Chief Steward of the Houſehold, and a Steward of the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in Ordinary, and others that ſerve quarterly, having a Stick in their Hands, ſet in Silver gilt at both Ends. They precede the Serving Gentlemen, when the Kings Meat goes by.</p>
               <p>There is a Grand Provoſt of <hi>France,</hi> or Provoſt of the Houſhold, which is a very ancient and authorized Office: Juſtice is exerciſed, under his Name, by two Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, the one in a long, and the other in a ſhort Gown, by Serjeants, and by fifty Archers, cloathed in <hi>Hoquetons</hi> or Caſſocks of Livery, that follow him, attend the Court,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38412:22"/> and proſecute the Guilty ſix Leagues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. He alſo makes the Procedures of criminal Cauſes betwixt the Officers of the King's Houſhold, and others that follow the Court; and when the King is on his March, he ſets a Price upon Bread, Wine, Fleſh, Hay, Oates, and other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>The Place of great Chamberlain is alſo very ancient, honourable and priviledged. He is Superintendant of the King's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of his Cloathings and Moveables. He lyes at the King's Feet, when he holds his Bed of Juſtice, or at the General States of the Kingdom, when the Kings uſed to call them.</p>
               <p>There are four Chief Gentlemen of the King's Chamber that ſerve quarterly, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Wardrobe, a Maſter of the Ceremonies, a Leader of Ambaſſadors, who all take the Oaths in the King's Hands.</p>
               <p>There was formerly a <hi>Grand Queux,</hi> or a Great Maſter of the King's Kitchin; but this Charge is now aboliſhed, there having been none ſince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Prie,</hi> Lord of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> who died under <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. <hi>An.</hi> 1490. There are yet four Maſters <hi>Queux</hi> or Cooks, who ſerve quarterly in the King's Kitchin.</p>
               <p>The Great Maſter of the Pantry, and the Grand Butler, or Cup-bearer of <hi>France,</hi> do
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38412:22"/> diſcharge their Duty but in great Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as at the King's Coronation, and the like; but there are Gentlemen of the King's Table, and Cup-bearers in ordinary, who make the Aſſay of the Meat and Drink that is preſented to the King.</p>
               <p>There is a great and little Stable of the King, the Gentlemen of the Little, paſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King when he is on Horſeback. The Great Maſter of the Horſe is conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon them all, and bears the Sword in a Velvet Scabbard, marked with Flower-de-Luces, on great Solemnities, before his Prince.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marſhals</hi> of <hi>France</hi> judge of all Military Cauſes, and have their Lieutenants and Provoſts to inform againſt, and ſeize upon Vagabonds and Deſerters. They or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily wear a Stick, as a Badge of their Dignity, and when they receive it from the King, they take the Oath of Allegiance to him, in the High Court of Parliament at <hi>Paris.</hi> The Seat of their Juriſdiction is at the Marble-Table in the Palace of that Court, where their Power is very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſince the Suppreſſion of the Charge of Lord Conſtable, upon whom they were formerly depending. However, this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is ſomewhat counterballanced by their great Increaſe in Number of late years.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor is the Head of all the Courts of Juſtice, and preſides in all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38412:23"/> the King's Councils in his Abſence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he cannot be deſtituted, but by Death or Treſpaſs. And therefore the Kings, to keep this great Miniſter in awe, have a Lord Keeper of the Seals, whom they cauſe to diſcharge the Chancellor's Functions, by giving him the Seals; in which Occaſion, the Chancellor retains no more but the bare Name of his Office. He has under him the Maſters of the Requeſts, who ſerve quarterly, judge the Differences between the Officers of the Crown, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ſuch Matters as are to come before the King's Great Council.</p>
               <p>This Council is now a Soveraign Court of Juſtice, whoſe Sentences are executed throughout the whole Kingdom; it's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the Chancellor and eight Maſters of Requeſts. From this Court iſſue all the Placates, Ordinances and Proclamations. There are alſo a Council of State, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Exchequer, a Privy-Council, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine Appeals and Conteſts about the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of Judges, and the Cabinet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who manages all the Affairs, and is as the Soul of the Realm.</p>
               <p>Beſides the twelve ancient Peers of <hi>France,</hi> there are near a hundred more created ſince two or three Centuries; but though they have the Priviledge to ſit in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Paris,</hi> and not to be judged by any other Court, yet they fall ſhort of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38412:23"/> the Luſtre and Power of the firſt Peers.</p>
               <p>The Knights of the Order of St. <hi>Michael</hi> inſtituted by <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. in 1469, are in no extraordinary Repute; and this Order is now only conſidered as a ſtep to that of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> inſtituted by <hi>Henry</hi> III. in 1570, whoſe Knights are fewer in number and more reſpected, it being given as a token of ſpecial Favour, and to ſuch as are already of St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi>'s Order, and conſidered by their Birth or Merits.</p>
               <p>I ſuperſede to ſpeak of the Lord Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the Vice-Admirals, and Rear-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; Of the Generals, Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, Maſters de Camp, Collonels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the Maſters of the Ordnance, of the Lord Treaſurers, Counſellors, and Secretaries of State; of the Ambaſſadors, Lord Almoner, Under Almoners, Chaplains in Ordinary, and other Officers, either Civil, Military, or Eccleſiaſtical, who are little or nothing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the like in <hi>England.</hi> But I muſt not forget to ſpeak a word of the King's Confeſſor, who, though he has ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally no more Power than the Clerk of the Cloſet here; yet, through the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Condeſcenſion of the late Kings, and the ſhrewd Management of thoſe cunning Politicians, <hi>Cotton, Annat</hi> and <hi>La Chaize,</hi> are become ſo powerful, as to get into their Hands, the Direction of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38412:24"/> Affairs of the Kingdom, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Conſcience. When the Jeſuits were recalled into <hi>France,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was adviſed to take one of theſe Fathers for his Confeſſor, who ſhould be as an Hoſtage for the Fidelity of the whole Club. But this very Caution proved his Ruine, for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cotton,</hi> whom he pitched upon, having firſt ſeduced his Queen, laid his Plot ſo well with <hi>Spain</hi> and his Fellow-Jeſuits, that the King was murthered by <hi>Ravaillac:</hi> And that <hi>Henry</hi>'s Ghoſtly Father and Queen had a Hand in this horrid Buſineſs, can hardly be doubted, after the Inſinuations the ſincere <hi>Mezeray</hi> gives of it.</p>
               <p>There are two Charges in <hi>France,</hi> the like I don't know that we have in <hi>England,</hi> or at leaſt they are not here in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration as in that Kingdom. The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers who diſcharge them, are always Counts, or Dukes, or Princes of the Blood, and are called the <hi>Great Huntſman,</hi> and the <hi>Great Falconer</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> They have large Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, Gifts and Profits, and ſeveral Officers under them, whoſe Places are at their Diſpoſal. The <hi>Captain General of the Hunting-Nets,</hi> and the <hi>Great Wolf-Hunter,</hi> keep likewiſe an honourable Rank, and all four are ſworn by the King himſelf.</p>
               <p>I ſhall finiſh this Chapter with mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Way of adminiſtring Juſtice in <hi>France.</hi> Suits are for the moſt part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced

But the late Miniſters, <hi>Richelieu, Mazarin, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> and <hi>Louvois,</hi> have ſo far undermined the Authority of theſe Courts, that they not only dare not reject any of the King's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, but dare not ſo much as make uſe of the Word <hi>Enteriné,</hi> their Style being now <hi>Lû &amp; verifié en Parlement:</hi> That is, <hi>Read and acknowledged for a true Writing, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the King.</hi> The Intendants are the Men, whom the Promoters of Arbitrary Power have made a ſpecial uſe of to bring down the Power of Parliaments. They are a kind of Overſeers, whom the French Kings began to ſend into the ſeveral Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Dominions fifty or ſixty years ago, and who, under pretence of ſetling the King's Revenues, reconciling Differences about it, or ſeeing Juſtice well done, have conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly encroached upon the Juriſdiction of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, without that the Complaints of the laſt were ever regarded at Court. The prepoſterous Zeal of theſe Magiſtrates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Reformed, was none of the leaſt Cauſes of their Decay; for as often as any Suit, wherein both Churches ſeemed to be concerned, came before them, we were ſure to get an <hi>Arrêt de Partage;</hi> or that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Preſident and Counſellors would
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38412:25"/> give their Voice in favour of the Defenders, whereas the Roman Catholicks would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide for the Plaintiffs, how ill grounded ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Actions might be. This of courſe brought the Deciſion of the Matter before the King's Council; ſo that our Reformed ſeeing that no Juſtice was to be hoped from the Parliament, made an Intereſt to remove the Cauſe before the King's Council, that they might avoid expences, which many other imitated, not without the ſecret Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Court.</p>

By what Means and Degrees Popery corrupted Chriſtianity, is not a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in this Proteſtant Kingdom; but I have ſome Obſervations to make upon the Progreſs and preſent State of that Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Worſhip in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's well known that Superſtition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to creep into the Church by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great Honour the Faithful rendered to thoſe Chriſtian Heroes, the Martyrs, who, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Heathen, that got a Name by their being troubleſome to others, ſignaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves by their own Sufferings. And with great reaſon were they ſo much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced, ſince the Pagan Antiquity, which mentions ſo many <hi>Hercules,</hi> can hardly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us with an <hi>Anaxarchus.</hi> While theſe couragious Athletes lay in Priſon, Sinners were releaſed of their Penances upon their Interceſſion; after their Death, their Tombs were the Gathering-place of the Faithful, and when God had given Peace to his Church, Temples were built upon, or near their Graves, and called after their Names. And as the Vulgar doth not know how to keep the golden middle Path, hates or loves, deſpiſes or praiſes to exceſs; So this due and lawful Remembrance ſoon degenerated into an Idolatrous Worſhip. Perhaps at the beginning it had been eaſie to Clergy-Men to put a Stop to that Superſtition; but the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38412:26"/> Generality found, it ſeems, their Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by it, and pious Men durſt not oppoſe the Current. However the <hi>Gauls</hi> had the Honour to produce one <hi>Jovinian,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Milan,</hi> who endured a long Perſecution for openly diſproving the creeping Practices of Coelibacy, Vows, and the Veneration of Reliques, in the time of St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> But a greater Man than <hi>Jovinian</hi> whom neither <hi>Italians</hi> nor <hi>Spaniards</hi> can challenge, is <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius;</hi> for he was born at <hi>Calaguri,</hi> a ſmall Borough near <hi>Cominges</hi> in <hi>Gaſcony.</hi> True it is, that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> diſputed againſt him with much Violence; but the Learned know, that the Conduct of this Father is not ſo much commended as his Science; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Out-crys, <hi>Vigilantius</hi> qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly died in the Communion of the Church, and left a great many Diſciples, who ſeem to have been the Fore-fathers of the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes;</hi> as thoſe of <hi>Jovinian</hi> maintained the Truth in the Churches of <hi>Italy,</hi> till <hi>Claudius,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Turin</hi> aroſe, and was ſucceeded by the <hi>Vaudois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Step of Superſtition, was the Worſhip of Images, which when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> could no longer oppoſe, God raiſed <hi>Charlemaign</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> who caus'd it to be condemned, together with the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> in another held at <hi>Francfort, Ann.</hi> 794.

By the Oppoſition of theſe great Men, this monſtrous Tenet was ſomewhat ſuppreſſed; but as it lifted up its Head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, after their Death, <hi>Berengarius,</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Angers,</hi> aroſe for the Truth, in 1035; was a long time maintained by ſeveral French Biſhops, againſt the Power and Perſecution of the Popes, and dy'd in the Communion of the Church <hi>Ann.</hi> 1088, not without ſolemnly recalling the nonſenſical Confeſſion which the Popes <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas</hi>

               <p>After <hi>Berengarius,</hi> the Aſſertors of the Truth had more dreadful Storms to go through; however, <hi>France</hi> was never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Chriſtian Heroes.

               <p>This Parliament, as it was the laſt, ſo it was at firſt the leaſt conſiderable next to that of <hi>Pau,</hi> the three Biſhopricks only reſorting to it. But ſince the Conqueſt of <hi>Lorrain, Luxemburg,</hi> and adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, its Juriſdiction is mightily inlarged. It made a great Noiſe ſome time after the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> about the Year 1680 when the French King erected there a Chamber of Dependencies, whoſe Judges ſummoned the Spaniſh Subjects to come and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38412:33"/> ſwear Allegiance to the French King, under pretence that they were depending upon ſome of his new Conqueſts. By this Shrewdneſs, he got more Lands during the Peace, than he had done in the War.</p>
               <p>The Dukedom of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> is under the Governour of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> but I ſuperſede to make a particular Deſcription of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Low-Countries deſerve a Treatiſe by it ſelf.

               <p>At a League's diſtance from the Town, is a Village called <hi>Jovy,</hi> where are ſtill to be ſeen ſome Remains of an Aqueduct, built by the Romans, with Arches of a fine white Stone, cut in Form of Bricks, and above Sixty Foot high.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, there is another conſiderable Place near <hi>Nancy,</hi> called St. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> that ſhould deſerve rather to be called one of the greateſt Towns of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> for the Number of its Inhabitants, and conſiderable Traffick, than a ſimple Borough, if it were walled in.

               <p>As for the Manners and Cuſtoms of the Inhabitants, they have been obſerved to be a Mixture of the German and French.

In <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s time, it reached from <hi>Rheims</hi> in <hi>Champain</hi> to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and thence to <hi>Tournay</hi> on the <hi>Scheld;</hi> ſo that it was extended an hundred and thirty Miles in length, fifty or ſixty in breadth in ſome places, and covered part of <hi>Champaign</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Liege,</hi> and of the Counties of <hi>Namur, Haynaut</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> which are now filled with ſo many fair Cities.

It's true, they have had ſome Lands in exchange, but they are not to be compared to theſe, either for Profit or Honour, were it but for the Title of Soveraignty. This Country, though it is covered with Woods, as I have hinted, does not want, however, a Competency of Corn, which makes the Abode both agreeable and cheap.

And indeed we ſee that it was firſt the Sirname of ſome Private Men, as of one <hi>Clement</hi> in 1023, and one <hi>William</hi> in 1099; and that in proceſs of time it became at laſt the name of the whole Province, as may be read in <hi>Nicolas de Bray,</hi> about the year 1215.

This is the Origin of what the <hi>Normans</hi> call the Clamour of <hi>Haro,</hi> which they make uſe of, when they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wrong'd or oppreſs'd, perhaps too often, as they are accus'd to be of a litigious Temper. Howſoever it may be, <hi>Haro</hi> ſeems to be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged word for <hi>Ha Raoul,</hi> as tho' they would ſtill implore the Juſtice of their firſt Duke. <hi>Raoul</hi> took the name of <hi>Robert</hi> at his Baptiſm, was ſucceeded by <hi>William</hi> I. ſurnamed <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſword</hi> in 917, or 920, and was ſucceeded by three Princes, named <hi>Richard, Robert</hi> II.

                  <hi>Beda</hi> relates, [<hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1.] That in old times ſome Armoricans came over into our Iſland, and maſter'd the Southern parts of it; however 'tis not from them that our Anceſtors got the Name of <hi>Brittains,</hi> ſince theſe Gauls were only known by that of <hi>Armorici,</hi> whereas it cannot be doubted but that our Brittains gave their Name to <hi>Brittanny:</hi>

               <p>So great a loſs however was not able to run them altogether down, for we find that even in the following Century they were a Terror to the French, ſo that <hi>Clovis</hi> the Great's Grand-Children, <hi>Theodebert</hi> and <hi>Thierry,</hi> were forc'd to keep Counts and Marqueſſes on the Frontiers, to oppoſe the Incurſions of the Brittains into the Territory of <hi>Nants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They being ſo Warlike, and their Caſtles and Forts being ſurrounded with Woods and Marſhes, the Captains of <hi>Charlemaign</hi> were not like to have ſubdued them as they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of the eighth Century, had they not divided themſelves into ſeveral petty prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities; notwithſtanding they recover'd their liberty under <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, by the Valour of <hi>Nomenoius</hi> and <hi>Heriſpoius</hi> his Son, to whom <hi>Charles</hi> yielded the Territories of <hi>Rennes, Nantes</hi> and <hi>Retz,</hi> when he ſaw that he could not recover them.</p>
               <p>Others relate the Settlement and Adventures of our Brittains ſomewhat differently. They ſay, that about the Year 393. a Brittiſh Captain, called <hi>Conan. Meriadoc,</hi> Lieutenant to <hi>Maximus,</hi> who had been ſaluted Emperor in <hi>England,</hi> in 382. obtained leave of his Maſter to erect a Kingdom in Little <hi>Brittain,</hi> which his Succeſſors enjoyed independently from any other till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Year 570. that <hi>Chilpric</hi> I.

                  <p>The City of <hi>Blois, Bleſum, Bleſae,</hi> or <hi>Caſtrum Bleſenſe,</hi> is ſituated upon the <hi>Loire,</hi> with the Title of County, Bailiwick, and Chamber of Accounts. It is almoſt equally diſtant from
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:38412:160"/> 
                     <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Tours,</hi> being near thirteen Leagues from the former to the Eaſt, and twelve from the latter to the Weſt. This Town has ſome Antiquity; for tho' <hi>Caeſar</hi> does not mention it, and that there be no great reaſon to take it for the <hi>Corbilo</hi> of <hi>Strabo;</hi> yet it appears by <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> that the Inhabitants were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in ſome conſideration in the V. &amp; VI. Centuries; ſince in conjunction with the <hi>Orlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> they invaded the <hi>Dun is,</hi> and <hi>Anno</hi> 584, kept Priſoner <hi>Eberulf</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> at <hi>Tours.</hi> The ſight of <hi>Blois</hi> is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant on the ſteep of a Hill on the North-ſide of the <hi>Loire,</hi> the River running through the Town and Suburb <hi>Vienne,</hi> that are joyn'd by a Stone-Bridge, whereon is a Pyramid, erected in 1598. With an Inſcription to ſhew that <hi>Henry</hi> IV. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buil'd it. There is a ſumptuous Caſtle, begun by the Kings <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. and <hi>Francis</hi> I. beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Queen <hi>Katharine</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and by ſeveral Dukes of <hi>Orleans.</hi> As alſo a curious Garden adorn'd with Water-ſpouts and antick Statues. <hi>Henry</hi> III. call'd here twice the States of his Kingdom in 1577 and 1588, and during the laſt of theſe Aſſemblies, caus'd <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the Cardinal <hi>Francis</hi> his Brother, to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd.</p>
                  <p>The excellency of the Air, and fertility of the Ground have given to <hi>Blois</hi> the Sir-name of, <hi>The City of Kings,</hi> or perhaps, it was becauſe in this Country, they brought up the Children of the <hi>Fr.</hi> Kings, and that ſome of the Kings themſelves have reſided there. To which may be added, That the firſt Counts of <hi>Blois</hi> were the Fore-fathers
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:38412:160"/> of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> from whom the preſent Kings are lineally deſcended, Theſe Counts were as Sovereign as are now the Electors and other Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> for they coyn'd Mony with an <hi>Hebraick</hi> Letter, a <hi>Flower de luce,</hi> and their own Name on one ſide; and on the backſide a croſs, with a <hi>B.</hi> and theſe two words <hi>Caſtro Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides what has been alledged for the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of <hi>Blois,</hi> there are remains of an <hi>Aqueduc,</hi> wherein three Men can ride on Horſeback a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſt, and 'tis the common Tradition of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants that at a Village call'd <hi>Orcheſe,</hi> almoſt 5 Miles Weſt of the Town, <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> kept his Magazines; which they endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm by the Ruins of ſome great Buildings, Arches ſtrong, and thick Walls, and the like Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but have no other ground that I know of.</p>
                  <p>As to new VVorks, beſides the Caſtle and Gardens, there is a Tennis Court eſteemed the biggeſt in <hi>France,</hi> being 57 Foot in length, and 20 in breadth.</p>
                  <p>Between <hi>Blois</hi> and <hi>Orcheſe,</hi> not far from that Village was diſcovered, about a hundred Years ſince, a Mine of <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> or ſeal'd Earth, which is pretended to be as good as that of <hi>Lemnos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Paſture Ground in the Valley of <hi>Loire,</hi> and the Exhalations that come out of the Vaults of St. <hi>Gervais</hi> are ſo wholeſome, that the Milk of the Cattle that feeds thereabouts is excellent, eſpecially the Cream that is eſteemed one of the Dainties of the Country: The <hi>Boon-Chriſtian</hi>-Pears, and Perdigron Plums are alſo rare Fruits,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:38412:161"/> and amongſt Handy-works, the VVatches of <hi>Blois</hi> have got a Name through the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but that which is moſt taking with Strangers, is the Purity of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue that is ſpoken here with a good Accent, as well by Country Men as by Gentlemen; and with all the charming Humour, and ſingular Honeſty of the Inhabitants. I had almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that <hi>Peter l'Hermite,</hi> the firſt Preacher of the <hi>Cruſado's,</hi> was a Native of <hi>Blois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho' the Royal Houſe and Park of <hi>Chambort</hi> or <hi>Chambourg,</hi> be not antient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, yet they deſerve a particular deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Houſe lies almoſt ſeven Miles Weſt of <hi>Blois,</hi> on the South ſide of the <hi>Loire,</hi> in the midſt of the Park, and of a pleaſant Foreſt. It was begun by King <hi>Francis</hi> I. at his coming out of the Priſon, at the ſame time that he built <hi>Madrid</hi>-Caſtle near <hi>Paris;</hi> but tho' he employ'd eighteen hundred Workmen at the building of <hi>Chambort,</hi> during twelve years, yet it was not perfectly finiſhed in his life time. A ſmall Brook abounding with Fiſh, ſurrounds the Palace, which is adorn'd with many little Towers and Chimneys, that give a very fine proſpect from far off, and the Foreſt is ſo pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through, that it hinders not the view of the adjacent Meadows, nor even of the Town of <hi>Blois,</hi> from the top of the Towers. The moſt remarkable thing is a Winding Stair-Caſe of 274 Steps, ſo large that ſeveral perſons can go abreaſt, and ſo contriv'd that thoſe who go up on one ſide and come down on the other, cannot ſee each other, tho' they can talk together. Add to this, that one may throw
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:38412:161"/> a Ball perpendicularly through the Newel, from the top of the Stairs to the bottom. At the end of the Queens Garden, which takes up five hundred acres of Land, towards the Foreſt of <hi>Blois,</hi> is a Lane of ſix thouſand great Elms, a Mile in length, and ſix Fathoms in breadth. I paſs over the other Curioſities to obſerve, that the Park is encompaſs'd with a ſquare-Wall, lying as a <hi>Parallelogramm</hi> inclin'd along the <hi>Loire,</hi> and cut through the River <hi>Couſſon,</hi> being three <hi>Italian</hi> Miles Eaſt and Weſt, two Miles North and South-Weſt, and one and two thirds North and South-Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>There are 6 other Towns of ſome conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the little extent of <hi>Blaiſois, Mer</hi> or <hi>Menars</hi> the Town and the Caſtle, <hi>Suevre-cour-ſur Loire</hi> and <hi>Die;</hi> theſe two lie over againſt <hi>Chambort,</hi> the former on the North, the latter on the South-ſide of the <hi>Loire; Onzain,</hi> mid-way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Amboiſe</hi> and <hi>Blois, Landes</hi> on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Vendomois,</hi> and <hi>Contres</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Soulogne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chateau-Dun, Caſtellodunum,</hi> is the Capital City of the little Country of <hi>Dunois,</hi> 11 Leagues North of <hi>Blois.</hi> It has its Name from the Hill, on which it's ſeated on the Eaſt-ſide of the <hi>Loir, Dun</hi> in old <hi>Gauliſh,</hi> ſignifying a Hill; but I know not where <hi>Ducheſne</hi> has found that it was antiently call'd <hi>Rubeclara,</hi> for <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbs Clara;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be ſeen from far off. There is a Caſtle ſtrong by its Scituation and Works; but the Suburbs are larger, and better built than the Town, which has been ruined by the Wars. It ſeems to have been conſiderable in the ſixth Century, ſince <hi>Sigebert,</hi> firſt King of <hi>Auſtraſia</hi>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:38412:162"/> erected it into a Biſhopprick; but <hi>Papole</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> form'd ſuch a Powerful Oppoſition to it in the fourth Council of <hi>Paris</hi> in 573, that <hi>Promotus</hi> the new Prelate was forc'd to ſtand off his Right, and to lead a private Life.

                     <hi>Chateaudun</hi> has an Election and Royal Seat of Juſtice, on which depend the <hi>Chaſtellenies</hi> of <hi>Montigny le Guanleon Courtalin, Monlitard, Leſclers</hi> and <hi>Rubetan,</hi> according to <hi>du Cheſne,</hi> but I find none of them in the moſt accurate Maps.</p>

In 1597. the Monks, who ſuſpected <hi>Henry</hi> IV. all his life, for having been once a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> taught a young Maid called <hi>Martha Broſſier,</hi> to counterfeit one that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of the Devil, and under that pretence, ſpread many things to the King's diſadvantage.

                     <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> relates that when King <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tran</hi> made his ſolemn Entrance into this City, <hi>Latins, Syrians</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> proclaim'd his Praiſes each in his Tongue; whether theſe different Nations were learned Men, or foreign Merchants, who inhabited or frequented this Town for the ſake of Trade, I ſhall not peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; tho' the latter ſeems to me the moſt probable. However it be, King <hi>Phillip</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi> ſounded here an Univerſity for the Civil Law in 1312. to which Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the V. added the Cannon Law, in thirteen hundred ſixty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The Scholars are divided into four Nations, <hi>French, Germans, Normands</hi> and <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards,</hi> each of which has its particular Officers. There are two common and well furniſh'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries.</p>
                  <p>This City has alſo undergone the various fate of War. We have already ſeen how it was rid from the hands of the barbarous <hi>Attila.</hi> In 1417. it ſtood out a long Siege againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> on behalf of the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> VII. The beſieg'd were ſo weak'ned and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd that they had reſolv'd to ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would not allow of it, tho' this Prince was their Ally, and then in their Army. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal may be reck'ned one of the chief cauſes of the Expulſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> as it was the fatal period of the progreſs of their Arms. For as on the one hand it gave a mighty diſguſt to this Duke, one of the moſt potent Princes in <hi>Europe;</hi> ſo on the other, the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:38412:165"/> 
                     <hi>French</hi> were not loath to make an advantage of it. They ſet up a young Maid, a Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of about eighteen years, who pretending a Revelation to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and bring the King triumphing into <hi>Rheims,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Coronation, ſo encourag'd their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited Army, and fright'nd the Enemies, that ſhe perform'd her promiſes; aſſiſted by the Valour and Conduct of the famous Count of <hi>Dunois,</hi> but perhaps more by the jealouſies rais'd between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> and then by the Civil Wars of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The Day of the Raiſing of this Siege, which was the Eighth of <hi>May</hi> 1418. is ſtill kept as a Solemn Feſtival in <hi>Orleans,</hi> and a Monument of this Victory has been erected on the Bridge of the City. It repreſents the Bl. Virgin with our Saviour in her Arms as ready to be buried; on one ſide lies King <hi>Charles</hi> VII. upon his Knees, and on the other the Virgin of <hi>Orleans,</hi> (as they call her now) Booted and Spurr'd as a Trooper. This Maid was call'd <hi>Jeanne d' Arc,</hi> ſhe was a Native of <hi>Vaucouleurs</hi> in <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> but her Family being Nobilitated by the <hi>French</hi> Kings, had their Name chang'd into that of <hi>Lys, Flower de Luce,</hi> in memorial of her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to that Crown.</p>
                  <p>During the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> II. in 1560. the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> under the pretence of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> diſarm'd the Inhabitants of <hi>Orleans,</hi> fill'd the ſuſpected Houſes with Soldiers, and then brought the young King, as triumphing, into the City. And well he might triumph, for he had gain'd his point ſo far, as to cauſe the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to be ſentenc'd to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:38412:165"/> loſe his Head. But the Death of <hi>Francis</hi> II. forc'd him to alter his Politicks. In 1562. the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> under the Command of the ſame Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> ſeiz'd upon this place, and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> himſelf was kill'd beſieging it. However the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> retook it, but <hi>La Noue,</hi> one of the ſtouteſt Commanders the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ever had, maſter'd it again, five years after. In 1588. it declar'd for the <hi>Leaguers</hi> by the Intreagues of one <hi>Roſſieux,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to the Duke of <hi>Mayenn,</hi> but it ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. in one thouſand five hundred ninety four.</p>
                  <p>The Name of <hi>Orleans</hi> comes undoubtedly from the <hi>Latin Aureliani,</hi> by which the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians after the ſecond Century do call this City. There is ſtill however ſome remains of the antient appellation of <hi>Genabum,</hi> in a nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name given to ſuch Inhabitants as have not Travelled abroad, <hi>viz. Guepin,</hi> which I am apt to take for an abbreviation of <hi>Guenapin, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabinus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This City is ſeated on the ſteep of an Hill on the Northern ſide of the <hi>Loire,</hi> that waſhes its Walls, and repreſents almoſt the figure of a ſtretched Bow. In ſight of the Town, and the middle of the River is a pleaſant Iſland cover'd with great Trees and Buildings. This Iſland is joyn'd with a Bridge on one ſide to the Town, and on the other, to the Suburb of <hi>Pontereau.</hi> This Bridge has 16 Arches, and 'tis upon it that the Monument of <hi>Jeane d' Arc</hi> is erected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Orleans</hi> is large and well built, the Streets are broad, ſtrait and neat, being pav'd with a ſmall ſquare-ſtone. Some of the Markets are fine,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:38412:166"/> ſpacious, and overſhadow'd with Trees. The moſt Magnificent Churches are the Cathedral of <hi>Sainte Croix,</hi> and the Collegiate of S. <hi>Aig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan.</hi> The body of the former is an hundred foot in length, ſixty in breadth, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and two in depth. It has fifty nine Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and nine Dignitaries; the latter has but thirty one Prebendaries, whereof eight are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify d. Both have been much defac'd during the Civil Wars of Religion, but the Cathedral was repair'd by <hi>Henry</hi> IV. There are twenty two Parochial Churches. The Town-Houſe has a very high Tower, whence the whole City and Suburbs may be diſcover'd. The <hi>Chaſtelet</hi> or Pallace of the Juſtice, is alſo a remarkable Building, ſeated on the River. The Town has eight Gates, and is fortify'd with a Terraſs, and ſurrounded with a Wall defended by 40 round Towers fill'd with Earth.</p>

                     <hi>Bourges, Avaricum Biturigum,</hi> and in latter Ages <hi>Biturigae, Bituricae, &amp; Betoricae,</hi> lies 19 Leagues South South-Eaſt of <hi>Orleans,</hi> upon the

It's ſeated in a Soil fertile in Fruits and Wine, that is not ſo delicate, but more health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than that of <hi>Orleans.</hi> The River <hi>Eure</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides it ſelf into three Branches, one of which ſerves to cleanſe the Town, and withal to Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Tanners, and the like; the other refreſhes the Ditches that ſurround the Walls, and the third runs along the Suburb of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Theſe three Branches being joined, and the <hi>Eure</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with the Waters of the <hi>Oron <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trio;</hi> the <hi>Aurette Avara Minor,</hi> and the <hi>Moulon Molo,</hi> near the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Sulpice,</hi> this River begins to be Navigable.</p>
                  <p>The Situation of <hi>Bourges</hi> is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, but alſo very ſtrong; for beſides theſe Rivers and Ditches, it is defended by broad and deep Marſhes, ſurrounded with good Walls, fortified with eighty Towers; ſo that three Camps would needs be required to beſiege it on all ſides; as one at <hi>Bourbon</hi>'s Gate, the other at <hi>Oron</hi>'s Gate, and the other at the Gate of St. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus. Ceſaer</hi> obſerves that he could not ſhut it up with Trenches, and laid ſiege to it only on that ſide that was between the River and the Marſh. Nevertheleſs, he took it partly by Storm, and partly by Stratagem, having raiſed two high Towers, whence his Soldiers leaped on the Wall, which ſo frighted the Gariſon and Inhabitants, that they retir'd to the great Market, and thence endeavoured to make their eſcape thorough the Gates; but the <hi>Romans</hi> having maſter'd them, ſpar'd neither Sex nor Age; they were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd at the Murther of their Fellow Soldiers
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:38412:178"/> in <hi>Gien.</hi> This was the Cauſe, that of 40000 People that were in this City, 800 hardly could ſave their Lives, by retiring into the Army of <hi>Vercingentorix,</hi> General of the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the V. Century, <hi>Bourges</hi> was taken from the <hi>Romans</hi> by the <hi>Viſigots,</hi> and from them by <hi>Clovis,</hi> and made part of the Kingdom of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> under <hi>Clodomir,</hi> and of that of <hi>Burgundy</hi> under <hi>Gontran</hi> his Nephews. <hi>Deſiderius,</hi> or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,</hi> General of <hi>Chilperic</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> took it from the laſt in 583, and burnt it almoſt intirely; <hi>Charlemaign</hi> repair'd it, and <hi>Phillip Auguſt</hi> fortified and adorn'd it with a Caſtle, call'd the <hi>Great Tower,</hi> which was almoſt quite ruined in 1651. It was cut Diamond wiſe on the outſide, and rais'd ſo high, that from the top, the Country might be viewed four Leagues round about. There has been ſeen a long time a Wood or Iron-Cage, where the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous King <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII. kept <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> Priſoner, who, nevertheleſs ſucceeded him. In 1412, the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> brought the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Charles</hi> the VI. before <hi>Bourges,</hi> whither the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates had retir'd, and laid ſiege to it with an Army of 100000 Men, but in vain; for at laſt both Parties were glad to accept of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Duke of <hi>Guyenn,</hi> then Dauphin of <hi>France.</hi> In 1562, The Count of <hi>Montgommery.</hi> Commander of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> under the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> ſeiz'd on this Town <hi>May</hi> 27; but left Governour therein one <hi>Yvoy,</hi> a Man of no great Courage and Truſt, who ſurrendered it the ſame Year to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remained in the Power of the Leaguers,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:38412:178"/> till 1594, that it was reduced by the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Henry</hi> the IV.</p>

Charlemaign</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Meek</hi> follow'd this diviſion when they ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it into a Kingdom for their youngeſt Sons. Moſt of thoſe Provinces were ſince poſſeſt by the Dukes of <hi>Guienne,</hi> fell to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the Marriage of the Dutcheſs <hi>Eleonor</hi> with <hi>Henry</hi> II. and were Conquered from them by <hi>Charles</hi> VII.</p>
               <p>The Dukes of <hi>Guienne</hi> had the third rank among the twelve Ancient Peers of <hi>France.</hi> The name of <hi>Guienne</hi> is a maimed Word from the Latin <hi>Aquitaniae,</hi> that is it ſelf deriv'd from <hi>Aquae,</hi> becauſe there are many Springs of Warm

It lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 42 D. 30 Min. and 46 D. 20 Min. of Latitude, and between 18 D. and 24 D. of Longitude, which amount from the South to the North to 100 Leagues, from <hi>Aragnoet,</hi> in the <hi>Pyrenées</hi> to <hi>Niort</hi> in <hi>Poictou,</hi> and to about 112 from <hi>St. John de Luz</hi> beyond <hi>Bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> to <hi>Saint Geniez</hi> in <hi>Rouergue</hi> near <hi>Gevaudan.</hi>

                  <p>The fourth Ward, call'd <hi>La Pierre,</hi> or <hi>the Stone,</hi> has nothing conſiderable.

There are beſides the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> a place well known by the cruelties againſt the <hi>Albigeois,</hi> near which is a round Caſtle, eſteem'd by <hi>Du Cheſne</hi> to be a remainder of the ancient

                  <p>The ſixth Ward call'd S. <hi>Pierre des Cuiſines,</hi> has among other Churches and Monaſteries, that of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Obſervantins,</hi> which exceeds all the reſt in bigneſs and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuoſity, but is eſpecially renowned for a <hi>Cave,</hi> which conſumes Dead-bodies, without anointing the Skin, and diſplacing the Joynts. Here is the Univerſity, with the College of <hi>Foix,</hi> founded by <hi>Peter</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Foix,</hi> and endow'd with two Libraries, one of Mſs. and the other of Printed Books, that of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> founded by <hi>Gambert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Arles</hi> and <hi>Narbonne</hi> in 1342, that of <hi>L'Equille,</hi> begun in 1561, and ended 1608 at the expences of the Town, for teaching the <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues. Here are alſo the Mills of the <hi>Baſacle,</hi> whoſe Workmanſhip is eſteem'd one of the greateſt curioſities of <hi>Toulouſe.</hi> This place, in <hi>Latin Vadaculum,</hi> that is ſmall foord, gives likewiſe its name to a Bridge and a gate, hard by the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh Ward call'd S. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> has the <hi>Caſtle Narbonnoiſe,</hi> which was the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Reſidence of the Counts of <hi>Toulouſe,</hi> and a very ſtrong place before K. <hi>Charles</hi> VII.

                  <p>The eighth Ward, under the name of S. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin</hi> or <hi>Saturnin,</hi> an ancient Collegiate Church, defended by Guns at the top of it, ſo plac'd,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:38412:229"/> that none of the many Pillars, which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop the Building, can cover a Man from their Shot. This they do becauſe of the great Treaſure, that is included in this Church, for there are above 50 Silver-skreens waſh'd over with Gold, beſides the Jewels and Church-orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Here are the Tombs of the ancient Counts of <hi>Toulouſe,</hi> of its Prelates and Nobility.</p>
                  <p>Five Miles North-Weſt of this City lies the Village or Lordſhip of <hi>Pibrac,</hi> which I mention here, for having giv'n its name to a <hi>Toulouſan</hi> Gentleman, <hi>Gui du Faur</hi> Lord of <hi>Pibrac,</hi> Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>France</hi> to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and then to <hi>Poland,</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> IX. and <hi>Hen.</hi> III.

It appears by ſeveral paſſages of this golden Book, that the Author was not at all addicted to the Superſtitions of <hi>Rome,</hi> though he never publickly embraced the Reformation, no more than divers other Great and Learned Men of his time, who ſeem'd to approve of the Doctrine, but did not like the manner of propogating it.</p>
                  <p>Seven Miles South-weſt of <hi>Toulouſe</hi> lies the Village of <hi>Plaiſance,</hi> ſo call'd from the goodneſs of its Air, Soyl, and Situation. <hi>Adrian de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois</hi> ſuppoſes it to be the <hi>Vernus Sol</hi> of <hi>Aethicus,</hi> but I rather take it for a place call'd <hi>Vernouſe,</hi>

Since they had began to follow this method; we read but of few Rebellions in their new and yearly conqueſts, and of a fewer in their Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Plantations.

<pb n="532" facs="tcp:38412:242"/> theſe Mountains. It ſeems that the <hi>Bebryces,</hi> who inhabited part of <hi>Bithynia</hi> were iſſued from this <hi>Gauliſh</hi> People, whom this Plantation weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo much, that the <hi>Tectoſages</hi> maſter'd their Country, or made it Tributary, whence it came that in proceſs of time they loſt their ancient Name as well as their Empire; for in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Age, they were only known as a part of the <hi>Tectoſages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Narbonne</hi> remained faithful to the <hi>Romans</hi> till the utmoſt decay of the Weſtern Empire, in 435, that it was beſieg'd by the <hi>Goths,</hi> under their King <hi>Theodoric.</hi> It then made a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reſiſtance; but in 462.

The <hi>Goths</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the demoliſhing of its Walls, and preſerv'd its other Monuments of Antiquity; but the barbarous <hi>Huns,</hi> who took it ſome time after, deſtroy'd them all. Notwithſtanding, it recover'd ſtill part of its former luſtre, and when the <hi>Saracens</hi> took and plunder'd it, in 732, it was become again the fineſt, the moſt famous, and the Capital of that Country, if we may believe <hi>Aimoin;</hi> but <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> who retook it not long after, made a greater havock in all <hi>Lower Languedoc</hi> than the Enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>However of all the miſchiefs <hi>Narbonne</hi> has been expos'd to, the moſt ſenſible ſeems to be the unworthy treatment it receiv'd from <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Montfort,</hi> who by the help of numerous <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades,</hi> having at laſt got the better of <hi>Raimond</hi>

                  <p>As to the Civil Government, we have hinted how this City was at firſt the head of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom under the <hi>Bebryces,</hi> then ſubject to the <hi>Tectoſages,</hi> and afterwards to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who made it the Capital of, and gave its name to the fourth part of <hi>Gaule,</hi> call'd from hence <hi>Gallia Narbonnenſis,</hi> and ſince ſubdivided into 5. Provinces, the 1 and 2 <hi>Narbonnoiſe,</hi> the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennoiſe,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Alps, and the <hi>Maritini</hi> Alps, that is, all <hi>Savoy, Dauphiné, Provence, Lower Languedoc, Rouſſillon,</hi> the <hi>Toulouſan,</hi> and the County of <hi>Foix.</hi> During the decay of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, under the ſecond race of their Kings, the Dukes of <hi>Septimania,</hi> took upon them the Title of Dukes of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> as did likewiſe the Counts of <hi>Toulouſe</hi> their Succeſſors; but the following Lords of this Town and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Territories, contented themſelves with the Name of Viſcounts, which they bore from 1134 to 1507. that <hi>Gaſton</hi> of <hi>Foix</hi> laſt Viſcount of <hi>Narbonne</hi> exchang'd it for other Lands with the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. his Uncle.</p>
                  <p>If we believe the Tradition of the moſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous of Roman Catholick Authors, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> converted by the Apoſtle of that name, was the firſt Preacher of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at <hi>Narbonne,</hi> and conſequently its firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. But though this Tradition be uncertain, this Church is however of a great antiquity; and there are plauſible proofs, that it has been a Metropolitan from the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:38412:243"/> Great in 309. and though the erection of <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe</hi> into an Archbiſhoprick, has reſtrain'd its Juriſdiction into narrower Limits; yet it has ſtill ten Suffragans, <hi>viz. Beziers, Agde, Lodeve, Maguelonne,</hi> now at <hi>Montpellier, Niſmes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſez, Carcaſſonne, Elne,</hi> now at <hi>Perpignan, S. Pons de Tomieres,</hi> and <hi>Alet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This City has been much bigger and larger than it is now, as appears by the ruins of the Palace of the <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Kings, that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Town. However it is ſtill conſiderable, eſpecially for its Fortifications, which render it one of the Keys of <hi>France,</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Pyrenees.</hi> In <hi>Pliny</hi>'s time, it was ſeated upon the River <hi>Aude,</hi> twelve <hi>Italian</hi> Miles South of the Sea, but is now nine or ten Miles only diſtant from it, which ſhews, that either the Sea has not gain'd upon the Land, or that this City has been rebuilt near the Shore. It is properly the <hi>Aude,</hi> that goes through <hi>Narhonne,</hi> and divides it into two Parts, the City and the Burough, but a Channel drawn from it, call'd <hi>La Robine.</hi> The Cathedral Church under the Name of St. <hi>Juſt,</hi> and St. <hi>Saviour</hi> is renowned for it's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, and the Picture of <hi>Lazarus</hi> riſing from the dead. There are 5 Pariſhes beſides, of which the moſt famous is the Collegiate of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The whole Dioceſe contains 4 Archdeaconſhips, that of <hi>Narbonne, Corbieres, Le Razès</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouillet,</hi> an Abby of <hi>Augustinians,</hi> call'd <hi>Our Lady of forty Notre-Dame de quarante,</hi> another of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternians,</hi> under the name of <hi>Notre-Dame de la Fon-frede,</hi> Our Lady of the cold Fountain, and ſeveral Monaſteries.

The City is higher than the Town, and incompaſſed with a double Wall, Towers, and deep Moats. It has a Caſtle with a Garriſon kept by the King in ordinary pay, a Preſidial-ſeat, and the firſt Seneſchalſhip of the Province.

That part which is called the Town is built along the River, and though moſt of the Houſes he made of Wood, yet they give a fine proſpect, becauſe the Streets are ſtrait-right, and end at a Square, whence the 4 Gates of the Town may be diſcover'd. It is ſurrounded with Baſtions and Rampiers, that make it capable of ſome defence. The Chief Trade of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants conſiſts in Box-combs, Serges, and Cloaths, whereof there are ſeveral Manufactures.

<pb n="546" facs="tcp:38412:249"/> the ſmall River <hi>Lez,</hi> which receives there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rivulet called <hi>Merdanſon,</hi> after it has ſerv'd to the uſes of the Town. The original of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier</hi> is related thus. There was formerly a ſtrong and conſiderable City call'd <hi>Maguelonne, Magalo,</hi> in a Gulph, nam'd by <hi>Pliny, Laterna,</hi> and by the <hi>French, l'Etang du Tau, de Lates,</hi> or <hi>de Perraut.</hi> The foundation of <hi>Maguelonne</hi> is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, for tho the Coaſt of <hi>Lower Languedoc</hi> has been ſometime in the power of the <hi>Marſeillois,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> mentions <hi>Alonis</hi> as an Iſland belonging to them, whoſe Inhabitants were call'd <hi>Alonites,</hi> yet having no other teſtimony, a ſmall and far fetched reſemblance of names can ſcarce prove them to be one and the ſame. However it be, ſure it is, that <hi>Maguelonne</hi> was an Epiſcopal City in the 5th and 6th Centuries, and a famous Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port too, which was the cauſe of its ruin: For after the <hi>Saracens</hi> had conquered <hi>Spain,</hi> they ſpread themſelves in <hi>Lower Languedoc,</hi> in 730, and threatned the whole Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> with a Barbarian Invaſion, when they were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly routed by <hi>Charles Martel</hi> near <hi>Tours.</hi> As this great Captain had obſerv'd that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly landed at <hi>Maguelonne;</hi> when it had reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this Town in 736, he raz'd it to the very ground, and transferred the Epiſcopal See to <hi>Soustancion, Sextatio,</hi> almoſt a Mile Eaſt of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier. Soustancion</hi> is mention'd in the Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Tables of the Emperor <hi>Theodoſe,</hi> and in the Travels of <hi>Aethicus;</hi> but the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants finding the Situation of the place, where now <hi>Montpellier</hi> lies more convenient, and the Air ſweeter, began to build there. Thus the new Village increas'd by degrees, during 300
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:38412:249"/> Years, that the B. of <hi>Maguelonne</hi> kept their Seat at <hi>Souſtancion.</hi> But in 1060, <hi>Arnauld Julian,</hi> one of theſe Prelates, rais'd up the Walls of <hi>Mague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nne,</hi> fortify'd them with Towers, and the Haven, where the <hi>Saracens</hi> us'd to land being ſtop'd, built another in a more convenient place. Before this the Governour of <hi>Maguelonne</hi> had retir'd to a place call'd now <hi>Mauguio,</hi> where he built a Caſtle under the name of <hi>Melgueil,</hi> and having uſurp'd the Sovereignty of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment during the troubles of the <hi>French</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, he took upon him the Title of Count of <hi>Melgueil</hi> and <hi>Souſtancion,</hi> and coyn'd a kind of ſmall Money call'd the <hi>Melgoris</hi> pence. The Eſtates of theſe Counts paſs'd in 1172 into the Houſe of <hi>Toulouſe,</hi> by the Marriage of <hi>Ermeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſende</hi> their Heireſs with <hi>Raymond</hi> VI.

                  <p>In the mean while, <hi>Montpellier</hi> increas'd apace; for it appears by a paſſage of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> Abbot of <hi>Clairvaux,</hi> that there was already a School or Seminary of Phyſicians, in 1155; and in 1156, we find mention of its Baths, which were farm'd by the Lords of that Town, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a conſiderable Revenue. However the firſt Inſtitution of its Univerſity is commonly aſcrib'd to the Diſciples of <hi>Averroes</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

About this time the Lords of <hi>Montpellier</hi> were in great eſteem. This Lordſhip was firſt detached from the Patrimony of the Counts of <hi>Melgueil</hi> to be the Portion of <hi>Eustorgia,</hi> a Daughter of that

                  <p>The moſt remarkable remains of Antiquity in <hi>Niſmes</hi> are its Amphitheatre, the Square-houſe, or <hi>Maiſon quarrée,</hi> the great Tower or <hi>Tourre-magne,</hi> the Fountain <hi>Nemauſus,</hi> and the Temple near this Fountain.</p>

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding one may ſtill diſcern the Figures of <hi>Remus</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> ſuckling a She-wolf, the Vultures that appeared to theſe Founders of <hi>Rome,</hi> two Bull-heads upon the ancient Gate of this Building, and two Towers upon the new Gate. The Seats whence the Spectators ſaw the Shews have been remov'd from thence, and the Caves where the wild Beaſts were kept are now fill'd up with Earth. Nay the whole capacity of the Amphitheatre is taken up with Houſes, at leaſt ſince the year 1179; as may be prov'd by Patentees granted by the Viſcount <hi>Bernard Atten,</hi> where the Inhabitants of <hi>Niſmes</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Arenes</hi> are diſtinguiſh'd; which ſhews, that this City has not been rebuilt where it formerly ſtood; for anciently the Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre was without the Town, and Warriors have oft made uſe of it, as of a Fort or Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel.</p>
                  <p>The Square-houſe, <hi>La Maiſon quarrée,</hi> is a kind of <hi>Parellelogramme,</hi> or long Square, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 74 Foot in length, and 41 Foot 6 Inches in breadth. Its front is adorned with 6 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, and each ſide with ten. The top is flat and cover'd with ſquare Free-ſtones extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary large, ſo that one may walk upon it without any danger. As we do not know who
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:38412:253"/> rais'd the Amphitheatre, we are not better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Founder of this Houſe, nor to what uſe it was fitted. For its form which has no likeneſs at all with the antient Baſilicks, does not allow us to take it for that magnificent Building rais'd up by <hi>Adrian;</hi> neither is the vulgar name of <hi>Cap-dueil</hi> ſufficient to make a Capitole of it, ſince no antient Author ſpeaks of a Capitole of <hi>Niſmes.</hi> But as its front has a great reſemblance with thoſe of the antient Temples; one may believe with the Learned <hi>Spon</hi> in his curious inquiries of Antiquity, that it was a Temple dedicated to <hi>Jupiter Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Without the Walls of the City upon the top of a high Hill, riſes an antient Building, call'd by the Inhabitants <hi>Tourre-Magne,</hi> the great Tower, becauſe of its prodigious height, or that it exceeded by far all the Towers round about. For by the remains it ſeems to have been a Watch or Tower, built in the form of a Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide at one of the Corners of its antient Walls. One may ſtill diſtinguiſh the Stairs, whereupon they aſcended to the top, and the Niches or Caſe-frames, wherein they plac'd the Statues of their Gods. The whole Fabrick is of ſmall ſquare Stones, ſo well cemented together, that the moſt induſtrious Maſon ſhould not throw down two Foot of it in a day.</p>
                  <p>At the Foot of that Hill ſprings a moſt clear and pleaſant Fountain, in the form of a Pond, with a Whirl-pool in the middle, wherein, if any Creature chance to fall, it is never to be ſeen again. This ſpring is the Source of the <hi>Viſtre,</hi> ſo call'd from the brittle and tranſparent
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:38412:254"/> colour of its Water, an <hi>Epithete</hi> given it by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonius, Vitrea non luce Nemauſus.</hi> A branch of this Fountain runs through a Channel pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely drawn into the City. As to the courſe of the <hi>Vistre,</hi> you may ſee it in the Rivers of <hi>Languedoc.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Near this Fountain is an old Square-Temple, under-propt by two rows of Columns with their Bars, Chapters, Architraves, Frizes, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes and Mouldings, all in a juſt proportion, together with Niches or Caſe-frames, and round Windows in the Walls, for the Statues of their Gods, and Eagles of emboſs'd Work, whoſe Heads have been broken off by the barbarous <hi>Goths, Huns,</hi> or <hi>Saracens</hi> in contempt of the <hi>Romans.</hi> This Temple has been turned into a Monaſtery of Nuns; and becauſe of the Eagles and other marks of its former magnificence, I ſhould be apt to take it for the <hi>Baſilick</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drien,</hi> rather than the Square-houſe, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther antient Building.</p>
                  <p>To avoid length, I ſhall not mention the many Statues and Inſcriptions that are found in this City, nor inſiſt upon the Monuments of newer date, as the Wine-Tower, <hi>La Tour Vina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiere,</hi> ſo call'd Becauſe built out of an exciſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Wine. <hi>Mont-pouzieu,</hi> in the incloſure of the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Bauzille</hi> is a Hill of Clay, that formerly was the burying-place of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for which, they us'd to pay a certain quantity of Pepper to the Monks.

After <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſe</hi>'s death <hi>Beaucaire</hi> return'd to the <hi>French</hi> Crown with the other Eſtates of thoſe Counts. In 1561 the Proteſtants took this Town, and put Garriſon in it under one <hi>Hardwin</hi> of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles,</hi> and the Roman Catholicks having reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, they were expell'd the ſame day with the loſs of 1200 Men. <hi>Beaucaire</hi> had then a Caſtle upon the Rock, on the Rivers ſide, which has been ſince demoliſh'd in 1632, on occaſion of new Civil Wars.</p>
                  <p>Three Miles South-Weſt of <hi>Beaucaire,</hi> lies betwixt Mountains the Town of <hi>Belle-garde,</hi> and 3 Miles South-Eaſt of <hi>Belle-garde</hi> the Village of <hi>Fourques Furcae,</hi> ſo called becauſe the <hi>Rhone</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides

Century, and a famous Abby that was built there under his name, which has been ſince given to ſecular Prieſts. It's ſaid that the <hi>Gottiſh</hi> Kings had there a Palace, and that this Town is to be underſtood by the name of <hi>Palatium Gothorum,</hi> which is found in the Authors of thoſe times. At leaſt it is ſure that the Counts of <hi>Toulouſe</hi> took the Title of Counts of S. <hi>Gilles,</hi> and that ſometimes the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was underſtood by that name. This Town belongs now to the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> under the Title of great Priory, and it was near it that the Proteſtants got a ſignal Victory over the Roman Catholicks, headed by the Count of <hi>Somme-rive</hi> in 1562.

<pb n="563" facs="tcp:38412:257"/> which are not digg'd out and improved for want of Slaves. The Proteſtants were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong in this Country, and the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Mountains enabled them to reſiſt <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. but no Foreign Power taking their part, and even their Brethren of other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces leaving them in the lurch they were ſoon forced to yield. In 1683, the Proteſtants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Loire,</hi> or of the Southern parts of <hi>France,</hi> drew up a project, which had it been made ſooner, or even then conſtantly and vigorouſly follow'd, would moſt probably have ſtopp'd the Perſecution. (For <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. how cruel ſoever he is, would have been loth to exterminate two Millions of Men.) Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they agreed amongſt them, as many as could come together from ſeveral parts in thoſe troubleſome times, not to comply willingly any longer, with the Edicts and Declarations given againſt 'em, in order to pull down their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to forbid their Aſſemblies, to put their Paſtors into Priſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to obey God rather than Men, and generouſly to encounter Death and Martyrdom, ſtill keeping themſelves in a paſſive and defenſive way. But the Inhabitants of the Wealthieſt Cities; eſpecially of ſuch where the number of Roman Catholicks prevail'd, could not aſſent to, nor put this project into Execution. They being thus divided, having no Head to command 'em, nor any ſettled union and correſpondence amongſt themſelves; this Brave and Chriſtian reſolution came to nothing, being only perform'd in ſome parts of the CE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENNES, and of the Valleys of <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> where it ſerv'd for a pretence to the Miniſters of the
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:38412:258"/> Popiſh barbarities, to repreſent 'em in Foreign Parts, as a ſet of ſeditious Men. However they never attacked any body; but becauſe the King's Dragons purſued them into Foreſts and Deſarts, whether ſoever they might retire themſelves, the Men went arm'd with the Women and Children to keep them harmleſs. But the King's Officers took their time ſo well, that they ſeiz'd on the moſt couragious, and got 'em broken upon the Wheel. Thoſe that remained united had the better fate, for many obtain'd paſſes to go out of the Kingdom. I have ſeen a young Man in <hi>Holland,</hi> who was one of the Heads of the <hi>Vivarois,</hi> that forc'd the Intendant or the King's Overſeer in the Province, to grant him a Paſs, and to 500 of his Camerades, and ſafely to conduct 'em on the Territories of <hi>Spain;</hi> whence, after they had ſuffered much by the blind and barbarous zeal of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the cruelty of the Inquiſitors, ſome at laſt made their eſcape into Proteſtant Countries.</p>

               <p>PROVENCE view'd in a Map affords but an unpleaſant proſpect, for it ſeems as though the greateſt part of it were cover'd with barren Mountains. However it is not ſo, for except in ſome few places of the Bayliwick of <hi>Seyne,</hi> bordering upon <hi>Embrunois,</hi> all the other Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are fruitful Hills or Hillocks, which not only produce the beſt Corn, and the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Wine in <hi>France,</hi> but ſometimes one and the ſame Mountain will yield ſuch Fruits as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a different Climate; being cover'd on the South ſide with Vines, Plume, and Olive-trees, Pomegranates, Oranges, Citrons, Limons, and on the North ſide with Cherries, Apples, Pears, Almonds, and Walnuts. Neither does the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

The Air is as temperate as the Soyl is fruitful, for the Sky is clear moſt part of the year, and rain falls very ſeldom. The Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts along the Sea-coaſt would be very hot, were it not for the <hi>Bize</hi> or North Wind, that refreſhes and purifies the Air, but creates a ſevere cold when it blows in Winter.

                     </gap> obſerved before all, that time out of mind the Lords of <hi>France</hi> were not properly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but only Vaſſals to the King, and Sovereigns under him; and that their Fees, Caſtles &amp; Mannors could not be ranſack'd or pull'd down, nor their Subjects abuſed or kill'd, unleſs it were for Crime of High Treaſon. Now the places of <hi>Merindol, Cabrireres, La Coſte, &amp;c.</hi> whether the <hi>Vaudois</hi> reſorted, belong'd to a Lord, who prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them, and all the Crimes they were found guilty of was to profeſs the ſame Religion, that was perſecuted in other Parts of <hi>France,</hi> and to give retreat to ſuch as eſcaped the bloody Hands of their Murderers. The <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Francis</hi> the I. prevailed upon by the Monks, gave out a ſevere Edict againſt all the Proteſtants, in 1535, and the Parliament of <hi>Aix</hi> condemned
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:38412:278"/> to be burned 19 Inhabitants of <hi>Merindol,</hi> and the neighbouring places, moſt of whom were Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; but the firſt Preſident <hi>Chaſſanée,</hi> a learned Lawyer ſuperſeded the Execution of it.

Thus they went on to <hi>Merindol,</hi> and were reinforced in their way by the Troops of the Pope's Legate from <hi>Avignon.</hi> The poor <hi>Vaudois</hi> retired into Woods and Mountains; ſo that the Perſecutor's Army found nothing in their Villages and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oughs; but old and ſick Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, however they had the Barbarity of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering every one of them, and burning and razing all their Habitations, nay even of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 30 of them, who had ſurrendred themſelves upon Terms. <hi>Maimburg</hi> confeſſes, that there were 3000 murdered, 600 ſent to the Gallies, 24 Villages, and 900 Houſes burnt; but others make it amount to a far greater number. This hapned in 1546, when <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt had Notice of it, he was ſenſible of the injuſtice they had done; ſaying, that they had made uſe of his Name, to deſtroy the moſt honeſt Men in his Kingdom, and therefore ordered at his Death, which happened ſome Months after, to his Son and Succeſſor, <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, that he ſhould not leave thoſe Barbarities unpuniſhed. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly this Prince immediately after his
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:38412:278"/> coming to the Crown, named Commiſſaries to judge of this Affair; but the Mony, and power of the Clergy, ſtopped their Mouths; ſo that the King was forced to remove the Suit before the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> by his Patents of 1551. Then the Perſecutors not being able to avoid Juſtice any longer, threw the hatred of all this horrid and unlawful Executions, upon ſome Soldiers who were dead, or whom they had cauſed to make their eſcape, and upon the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate General <hi>Guerin,</hi> who was beheaded in the place of <hi>Greve.</hi> As to the Baron of <hi>Oppede,</hi> tho his Credit ſav'd him from the hands of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Juſtice; yet it could not deliver him from the hands of God, who called him before his Tribunal in 1558, by the moſt painful Death that ever was, as you may ſee in <hi>Thuanus, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleix,</hi> and other Roman Catholick Hiſtorians.</p>

                  <p>THE County <hi>Venaiſſin,</hi> that is now a dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Papal See, borders on <hi>Provence</hi> to the Eaſt; on <hi>Dauphiné</hi> to the North; on the <hi>Durance</hi> to the South; and on <hi>Languedoc</hi> to the Weſt. It is about 13 or 14 Leagues from South to North, and from Weſt to Eaſt; it is the firſt of the Pope's Legateſhips, a fruitful and pleaſant Country; there are an Archbiſhoprick, 3 Biſhopricks, 4 Baronies, and 78 Towns, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs or Villages.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Romans</hi> time, it was inhabited by the <hi>Cavares</hi> and <hi>Memini,</hi> ſince it paſs'd under the <hi>French,</hi> and from them to the Marqueſſes and
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:38412:279"/> the Counts of <hi>Provence.</hi> In 1228 the Eſtates of <hi>Raimond</hi> Count of <hi>Toulouſe,</hi> having been ſeiz'd from him, becauſe of his protecting the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geois,</hi> it was agreed amongſt the Uſurpers, that the Lands which <hi>Raimond</hi> had poſſeſt on the Eaſt of the <hi>Rhone</hi> ſhould be ſettled in truſt, only for a time, to <hi>Gregory</hi> IX. as appears by the Letters of this Pope to the <hi>French</hi> K. <hi>Lewis</hi> IX. and Queen <hi>Blanche</hi> his Mother, in 1230, and 1233. Its modern name <hi>Venaiſſin</hi> comes from <hi>Venatione,</hi> becauſe of the vaſt quantity of Game that is in this Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Avignon</hi> and its Territory made up a ſeparate Dominion; which ſtill belong'd to the Counts of <hi>Provence;</hi> but in 1348 <hi>Jane</hi> Queen of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Hereupon the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorians obſerve, 1. That this Princeſs being born in 1328. was not yet out of Age, no more than her ſecond Husband <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Taran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.</hi> 2dly. That the ſale was made without the conſent of the Guardians given her by K. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> her Grandfather, when he inſtituted her his Univerſal Heir againſt his expreſs will. 3. That ſome years after the ſame Pope to hinder Queen <hi>Jane</hi> of ſelling others of her Countries, gave out a <hi>Bull</hi> declaring void all the aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made, or to be made by the ſaid Queen, both in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and in the
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:38412:279"/> County of <hi>Provence,</hi> againſt the will of the ſaid K. <hi>Robert</hi> her Grandfather. 4thly. That in 1365 Queen <hi>Jane</hi> declar'd void the ſale of <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and all the others ſhe had made to that very time.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Chief reaſons on which the <hi>French</hi> Kings ground their pretenſions over <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignon</hi> and County <hi>Venaiſſin,</hi> and for which they never fail of ſeizing upon this City and County, as ſoon as they are at variance with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as did <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. in 1663. and 1688. I leave the Reader to judge of them, as he may do very impartially, ſince they are both our Enemies; only with this difference, that the one, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope is irreconcilable to us as long as we are Proteſtants, whereas within ſome years we may be at peace with the other.</p>

It has a Court of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition; a Mint where Money is coyned with the Pope's Arms; its Walls are fine, its Churches magnificent, its Avenues pleaſant.

They add further, that there is more or leſs Water in ſeveral years, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Harveſt is to be more or leſs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, which is ſignified in reſpect to Corn by one of theſe Tubs, and in regard of VVine by the other. Divers Authors mention theſe Tubs, and I have often heard of them, but I never had occaſion to examin this pretended wonder, nor did I ever ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with any Man of Repute, who had been an Eye-witneſs of it, or who gave any credit to this relation.</p>
                     <p>Half-way between <hi>Grenoble</hi> and <hi>Saſſenage,</hi> is <hi>La Tour Sans Venin,</hi> another wonder of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> where 'tis ſaid, that no Venemous Creature can live no more than in <hi>Ireand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seven Miles North of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> is <hi>La Grand, Chartreuſe,</hi> the chief Habitation of the Cartuſian Monks, and the ordinary Reſidence of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. It's a magnificent Building in a fine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, in the middle of ſteep and rugged Rocks. It was founded in the 11th Century, by one <hi>Bruno,</hi> who weary of the VVorld, retired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:38412:288"/> and had leave given him, by <hi>Hugh,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> to build there a Chappel, and ſince a Monaſtery, which in proceſs of time increaſed to that height, that it became the Head of the Cartuſian Order, and theſe Solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the richeſt of all the Fryars, as they are ſtill, unleſs the Jeſuits do exceed them. All thoſe who go to pay theſe Monks a Viſit, are kindly received, and entertained by the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Houſe; for the Monks themſelves ſpeak to no body, unleſs it be at cettain Hours, and that in very few words, which is a fair pretence to conceal the groſs Ignorance wherein they are kept. They will ſhew you all the Curioſities thereabouts, without enquiring what Religion you are of, at leaſt it was ſo, ſome time before the laſt Perſecution.</p>
                     <p>Remounting the <hi>Ifere,</hi> nine Leagues North of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> 11 Miles from the <hi>Grand Chartreuſe,</hi> and five South of <hi>Montmelian,</hi> lies <hi>Fort de Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raux,</hi> ſituated on a Mountain near that River. It is not quite ſo ſtrong as <hi>Montmelian</hi> was of late; however 'tis the Key of <hi>France</hi> on that ſide. In 1528, <hi>March</hi> 13. the Duke of <hi>Leſdiguieres</hi> took it by Storm from the Leaguers in two hours time.</p>
                     <p>On the South of the <hi>Iſere,</hi> two Leagues Eaſt of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> lies the Village of <hi>Giere,</hi> which I mention here for a natural Curioſity, the like I never met with elſe where; namely, a <hi>Caſcade,</hi> or VVater-Fall, that precipitates it ſelf down from a ſteep Rock, almoſt as high as the Steeple of <hi>Bow-Church,</hi> and as thick as two Men; and after it has run ſome ſteps into a ſmall Rivulet, is brought thorough Lead Pipes into a Garden,
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:38412:289"/> where it ſpouts with an incredible Violence, as high as any Tree; ſo that if this Place were not neglected, but Art were joined to Nature, it would make the fineſt VVater-fall and Spout in the VVorld.</p>
                     <p>The Gardens, and Park of <hi>Vizille,</hi> three Leagues South-weſt of <hi>Grenoble</hi> are much better kept, becauſe they belong'd to the Dukes of <hi>Leſdiguieres,</hi> which during three Generations, and almoſt an Age, have enjoy'd the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Dauphiné.</hi> The Park is encompaſſed with Walls of almoſt three Leagues in circuit. There are ſmall Hills and Vallies, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all Beaſts of Game. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a <hi>Meſnagerie,</hi> where they keep Foreign Birds. But the moſt conſiderable piece is what they call, tho ſomewhat improperly the Caſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. for 'tis rather the Bed of a ſmall Brook of a Mile or two in length, pav'd with Free large Stone, and divided into Squares of 5 or 6 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms; ſo that the Water falls by degrees from the Duke's Pallace to the end of the Park.</p>
                     <p>The Vally of <hi>Trieves</hi> is conſiderable for the abundance of its Gentry, and the three Towns of <hi>La mure, Mens</hi> and <hi>Corps.</hi> The reſemblance of the Names makes <hi>Holſtenius</hi> take the ſecond for the habitation of the ancient <hi>Mimenii,</hi> and the third for that of the <hi>Tricorii.</hi> This Vally is yet famous for a place call'd the <hi>Burning-Fountain,</hi> which was indeed ſo in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s time, and even about 50 Years ago; but whether that the Sulphureal Steams were then ſpent, or by ſome other accident unknown to me, the ſmall Rivulet, that ran over the Burning-place, lies now ſome ſteps farther. However, 'tis ſtill
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:38412:289"/> admirable enough to ſee a low place vomit Smoak and Flames, without any appearance of Hollowneſs or combuſtible Matter; and that the Minerals, that are the ſource of thoſe Steams ſhould have laſted Time out of Mind, without any ſenſible dimunition. And therefore this place is ſtill accounted one of the ſeven Wonders of <hi>Dauphine.</hi> At night, eſpecially in cold Weather, or when it rains but ſlowly, the Flames are very ſenſible; but in the heat of the Day, or after a violent Rain, there appears but a Smoak, which, being put on Fire by kindled Straw, draws out other Vapours; ſo that the Flame laſteth a conſiderable time.</p>
                     <p>The ſmall Country of <hi>Royanez,</hi> the moſt Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly of <hi>GRESIVA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DAN,</hi> along the <hi>Iſere,</hi> has two Marquiſates, <hi>La Baume</hi> and <hi>Pont de Royan,</hi> which laſt is a large Burough, where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants had a Church, and a Miniſter that made himſelf known of late, ſeveral ways.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This County is Mountainous all over, tho' fruitful in Wine and Corn, and aboundant with Paſture-ground. The moſt remarkable is <hi>Mont-Aiguille,</hi>

                     <p>Near this Mountain is the Vally of <hi>Vercors,</hi> which keeps yet ſomething of the Name of the <hi>Vocontii,</hi> or rather of a ſmall Tract of Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, and called <hi>Vertacomicoros.

                     <p>This Town was full of Proteſtants before the the laſt Perſecution, becauſe they had there a Colledge and Univerſity proper to them, for Philoſophy and Divinity. The <hi>Lombards</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſters of <hi>Die</hi> in 1514; and after the laſt diſmembring of the Kingdom of <hi>Arles</hi> or <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> the Sovereignty of it was uſurped by the Biſhops, or ſome Lords under them. They bore the Title of Counts, and were iſſued from the Houſe of <hi>Forcalquier,</hi> who poſſeſſed it du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the 11 and 12th Century; at the end of which it paſſed to the Houſe of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> who already enjoyed the County of <hi>Valentimois,</hi> but <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Poictiers</hi> ſold them both to the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the VI. in 1404; and ſo they were united to the reſt of the Province.
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:38412:291"/> The Proteſtants took this Town twice during the civil Wars in 1577 and 1585; and the laſt time raz'd the Cittadel.

They add, that he was a Native of <hi>Vienne,</hi> but there is no proof of his being born or ever exil'd thither, and this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Tradition ſeems to take its Original from <hi>Humbert Pilati,</hi> Secretary to the laſt <hi>Dauphin,</hi> who had a Country-Houſe near St. <hi>Vallier,</hi> which the vulgar alſo calls the <hi>Houſe of Pilate.</hi>

                  <p>The Emperor <hi>Galba</hi> granted many Privileges to this Town, in requital of the affection of its Citizens, who had declared for him againſt <hi>Nero,</hi> whilſt thoſe of <hi>Lyons</hi> held ſtill for that Tyrant, wherefore he alſo confiſcated their Goods.

                  <p>Beſides all this <hi>Vienne</hi> is remarkable for the Baniſhment of <hi>Archelaus, Herode</hi> the Great's Son and Succeſſor; for being the Native Country of <hi>Valerius Aſiaticus,</hi> who was twice Conſul, which ſhews that the <hi>Viennois</hi> were a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens born, and might become Senators in that Capital of the World. There alſo it was that <hi>Julianus Caeſar</hi> began his Conſulſhip by the Celebration of ſolemn Games; that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Valentinian</hi> the young was kill'd by Count <hi>Arbogaſt; Conſtant</hi> the Uſurper by <hi>Gerontius,</hi> and <hi>Godegile</hi> Prince of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gondebaud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had adorned <hi>Vienne,</hi> in which they much delighted, with ſeveral Magnificent Buildings, as an Amphitheatre, an Aqueduct, a Palace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof there are ſtill conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able remains, and this is not at all ſtrange, ſince <hi>Vienne</hi> was the Capital of the <hi>Narbonnoiſe,</hi> which they firſt conquered and beautified above the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Burgundians</hi> were the firſt, who took this Town from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and made it the head of their Kingdoms, but after they had been ſubdued by the <hi>French, Vienne</hi> remained united to that Monarchy, till it became part of a ſecond Kingdom of the <hi>Burgundians</hi> in <hi>Charles</hi> the Simple's time.

In proceſs of time <hi>Arles,</hi> one of its Suffragans growing in Wealth and bigneſs, was erected into an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick, and deprived its Metropolitan of ſeven of its Suffragans, of which however it kept but 4, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Paul Trois Chasteaux, Orange, Marſeille</hi> and <hi>Toulon;</hi> the Popes making after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their dear <hi>Avignon</hi> an Archbiſhoprick, and ſubjecting to it the Cities of <hi>Vaiſon, Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon,</hi> and <hi>Carpentras;</hi> ſo that the Metropolitan of <hi>Vienne,</hi> has now but 5 real Suffragans, <hi>viz.

                  <p>But the greateſt unhappineſs of <hi>Vienne</hi> came from that which was deſigned to keep the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre of its Metropolitans, namely, the Gift which

Among the Monaſteries of <hi>Valence</hi> is moſt eminent, the Abby of St. <hi>Ruff</hi> chief of the Order of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> eſteemed one of the moſt ſumptuous Buildings of all <hi>Dauphine.</hi> The Foundation of this Town is uncertain, but it appears by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſcriptions and Roman Monuments, that it is very antient. It is divided into Town and Burrough, and is defended by a Cittadel; for the other Fortifications which <hi>Francis</hi> the I. deſigned to make at <hi>Grenoble</hi> and <hi>Valence</hi> were never finiſhed. In the Town are two Fountains, whoſe Conduits ſaid to have been built by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar,</hi> are indeed a Work of the Roman Magnificence; for they are vaulted, and ſo big that a Man may walk upright in them: the ſource and the end of one cannot be diſcovered, and along the other, which waters the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Meadows, are the ruins of ſeveral an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Buildings. The Country People do not want fabulous Traditions, no more than their Neighbours at <hi>Vienne;</hi> for they will tell you ſtrange Stories of a Giant called <hi>Briard,</hi> who was 15 Cubits high, and ſhew you ſome mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous remains of his Bones; nay the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Fryers aſſure, that they have ſtill his true Picture, which they do not fail to ſhew to Strangers.</p>

                     <hi>Ducheſne</hi> relates, that in the Neighbouring Vineyards was diſcovered a Grave, at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which was ſeen a Woman, having a golden Ring at each of her ears, with a Turky-ſtone and Emerald inchaſed in them; at her Feet was a Cup of Criſtal, and at her Head a Lamp of Glaſs, but aſſoon as this dead Body was expoſed to the piercing Air, it turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to duſt. Between <hi>Valence</hi> and the fall of the <hi>Iſere</hi> into the <hi>Rhone,</hi> at a Leagues diſtance from both is the Village of <hi>Confolen,</hi> where <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> gave a total overthrow to the <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Forces, in the Year 633 of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>Thirteen Miles South-Eaſt of <hi>Valence,</hi> upon the River <hi>Drome,</hi> lies the Town of <hi>Creſt,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a dependance of the <hi>Segalauni,</hi> and a Caſtle of the Counts of VALENTINOIS. This <hi>French</hi> name is derived from the Latin <hi>Criſta;</hi> becauſe this Caſtle being ſeated between the River and a Neighbouring Mountain, appear'd as the Cap or the Comb of a Cock; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the place of Arms of the Counts of VALENTINOIS, and the Count of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> beſieged it in vain, in the 13th. Age. As this Town is conveniently ſeated between the Dioceſſes of <hi>Valence</hi> and <hi>Die,</hi> ſo it was the Seat of Juſtice for the upper part of both Counties. 'Tis obſerved, that in 1469, one <hi>John Rabot</hi> made a new Statute-Book divided in a hundred Articles, which were afterwards confirmed by the Parliament of <hi>Dauphiné. Creſt</hi> had declared it ſelf for the League in the laſt Century, but its Governor <hi>Montoiſon</hi> ſurrender'd it to the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, in 1589, and ſince that time its Tower has been demoliſhed.
